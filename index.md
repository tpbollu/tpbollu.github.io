I'm a [Helen Hay Whitney](http://hhwf.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow with [Martyn Goulding](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/martyn-goulding/) at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. I am currently studying the nature of real time sensory inputs measured by peripheral end-organs such as muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, and how they are utilized by the central nervous system for the learning and execution of precise, accurate movements.

I did my PhD research with [Jesse Goldberg](https://nbb.cornell.edu/jesse-h-goldberg) at [Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University](https://nbb.cornell.edu/). I studied the role of motor cortex in controlling precise forelimb and lingual movements by developing behavioral tools that provided micron-millisecond resolution of kinematics.

For my Master's research in the labs of [Chris Schaffer and Nozomi Nishimura](https://snlab.bme.cornell.edu/) and [Peter Doerschuk](https://doerschuklab.bme.cornell.edu/) at [Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University](https://www.bme.cornell.edu/bme), I developed and experimentally validated models of neurovascular blood flow in the murine cortex. I then used these models to make quantitative predictions of flow redistributions following strokes and neural activation.
