+ I'm a Neuroscientist with training in Electrical Engineering, Molecular Biology, and Neuroethology.

+ I want to figure out how biological nervous systems generate behavior. I've studied this in different parts of the nervous system, in different effectors and species. Specifically I have,
	+ Discovered the neural code for how the nervous system represents the motion of the limb in the spinal cord.
	+ Identified and a validated a population neural code for touch-related pain in the brainstem. 
	+ Showed that the motor cortex is required for the fine scale movements of the tongue and arm.

+ I address biological questions by building novel tools to precisely measure and perturb animal behavior - all of these tools were state-of-the-art when deployed. e.g.
	+ A robotic system to precisely move the limb of a mouse with micron-millisecond resolution and apply micro-newton scale coriolis forces in real time.
	+ A deep-learning based system to track tongue kinematics with ~10 micron resolution
	+ A hall-sensor based joystick for mice with micron-millisecond resolution, and a fully automated high-throughput system that trains mice to use these devices in closed-loop.

+ I'm currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Salk Institute, I did my PhD and M.Eng at Cornell. My research has been supported by several competitive fellowships.
	+ Postdoctoral Fellow with [Martyn Goulding](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/martyn-goulding/) at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. My work at the Salk has been supported by fellowships from the [Helen Hay Whitney Foundation](http://hhwf.org/) and the [Brown Foundation](https://www.thebrownfoundation.org/).
	+ PhD research with [Jesse Goldberg](https://nbb.cornell.edu/jesse-h-goldberg) at [Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University](https://nbb.cornell.edu/). Supported by a Cornell-Mong Neurotech Fellowship and a Cornell University Fellowship.
	+ Master's Thesis in the labs of [Chris Schaffer and Nozomi Nishimura](https://snlab.bme.cornell.edu/) and [Peter Doerschuk](https://doerschuklab.bme.cornell.edu/) at [Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University](https://www.bme.cornell.edu/bme).
